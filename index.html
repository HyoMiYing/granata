            <p>Yourstruly listens to this Rocco Granata record quite regularly. At least a couple of times per month. Prefer to roll it when cooking or eating. I would never listen to it while cleaning, reading, or doing any kind of work.</p>
            <p>It makes me feel festive and upbeat. I feel like a part of community.</p>
            <p>I got it for 0,50â‚¬ at Rataplein thrift store at Van Slingelandtstraat, Amsterdam. Went in my friend, and also got a slick lacoste bag with it. Haven't used the lacoste bag since. My girlfriend uses it now to put salad bowls in.</p>
